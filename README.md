This is a readme for our Simple-shell project,which we'll be building ourselves from scratch. And it's the last C project for the first trimester of our ALX software engineering training.
The shell is basically a command line interface(CLI) that accepts commands from the user's keyboard and passes them to the operating system to work on.
Collaborating on this project are @vikmokut and @Amarajah
